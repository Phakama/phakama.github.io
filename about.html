					HTML5 comes with great features that makes it differ from the normal HTML. Its semantic elements are great and making life easy with less code.A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer e.g table, form, and article clearly defines its elemnts. There's a number of new HTML API's and elemnts. Better support for audios and video and many more.

					I am a Front-end developer and a User Experience designer who is passionate about User Experience on the design and development of front end user interface and interactions. I'm currently a Web developer at Construction Computer Software, where I from time to time work on front end and back end side of development. I have passion about User Experience and searching for an opportunity to work as a full time UX consultant and front end development when necessary, in a company that believes in and practice UX best practices. I want to play a role in ensuring that UX best practices are implemented within projects that I will be working on. I am a hard working individual who puts a lot of effort into my work and willing to go an extra mile to meet the company's goal and ensuring that the user's needs are met. I'm willing, well let me rephrase! I'm hungry to learn new skills and stay up to date with industry trends, that makes me more flexible and a good problem solver with an ability to effectively research and gather user's needs to design the effective solution to solve user's problems. I believe in making users finish their job with less possible effort.
